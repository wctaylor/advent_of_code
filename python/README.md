# Advent of Code - Python

This directory contains my Python solutions to Advent of Code puzzles.

## Requirements

I am using Python 3.10 on Linux to develop these solutions, 
so that's all that I'll call "supported".
I intend to solve each problem using only the standard library or
custom classes, so there should be no other installation requirements.

## Running the Code

Once you have cloned the code using `git`, these commands should be everything
that's required
```
cd /path/to/advent_of_code/python/src
python main.py <year> <day>
```
